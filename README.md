For my design choices, I put a simple nav bar at the top for ease of access through the site with an eye-catching home page. After, I put three sections including new
items and different sections of products for people to see when they scroll down. Below this, I put a few products for people to easily look at and see the price of.
After this, I put an about page and a contact page. I believe that this design is easy to look at and use for customers, which should up the value for a client. My
audience are people who buy clothes, and I wanted to catch their attention by using big pictures and text, with a lot of options for them to choose from.
